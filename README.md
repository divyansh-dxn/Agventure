India is a land of agriculture where variety of crops grows, still the farmers are facing economic problems. Middlemen raise prices for consumers while underpaying farmers, leaving farmers poor and unproductive. Farmers encounter high production cost in their effort to boost production but hardly get fair pricing of their produces from middlemen. Our solution aim at removing middlemen.
